Tiny racing drones in space. 

A very large vehicle with a pilot will need to achieve high acceleration and speeds to "feel fast" , however a very small vehicle that moves very close to objects around it can move at very humble speeds with very humble (realistic) accelerations and still "feel fast" in the FPV camera, because objects mere inches and feet away from the camera will move quickly across the screen. 

A very large vehicle will also require very large objects to move past in order to percieve the speed. If a very large space racer were flying among land-forms, it would require very large mountains and deep chasms. However, if a very tiny vehicle were to move around land-forms, it would be able to have a similar experience moving past piles no taller than a person and chasms no deeper than a few feet. 

Deep in space drifts a giant space station in the shape of a ring, designed for mining massive asteroids. The ring station spins to produce artificial gravity, and mining dust is piled into mountains around the ring, creating a vast wilderness where dust may be mined again later, or allowed to gradually be recovered into soil. The miners are excellent pilots of small craft, and a popular hobby is to race around the zero-gravity environments of the docks and nearby, flying through inflatable gates. Very rarely, however, it is critical for station maintenance to de-spin the station, creating a rare situation where these racing pilots can fly among the mountains of mining waste, as though through a planetary landscape, but with zero gravity to encumber them, allowing them to mesh deep space thruster racing, with mountainous surface style landforms.
