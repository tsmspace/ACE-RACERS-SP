Plot outline points

THe giant spin station has a new arrival. A massive upgrade project will see a huge space ship first dock to the station, and then be transformed into a new module for the station. In order to install the module, all of the station modules must be repositioned for stable spin. In order to do this, the station must be de-spun.

Most of the racers that will participate are already crew members of the station, although some participants have arrived with the station installation.

Under normal circumstances, shipping weight is a significant limitation, largely preventing the smuggling of large items. However, after the station is despun to dock the craft in the location it will be unpacked and assembled on the station, a large smuggled item is discovered and operations are halted to facilitate for an investigation and actions to be taken to deal with the item, causing a significant delay in the project, and leaving the station with zero-gravity for an extended period of time. 

Racers are now in the situation where they will have an undetermined amount of extra time to hold races, meaning they have the opportunity to fly constantly around the terrain for much longer than would normally be possible.
