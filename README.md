# ACE-RACERS-SP
story development 

The goal of this project is to create an open-source story platform for the purpose of developing some "plot options" and character options for the enrichment of a game universe or multiple game universes. Of course normal story formats are also welcome. 

check out tsmspace.com

to read the "initial notes" with all of the text visible, just use the "raw" button. The "initial notes" are a set of setting concepts that I consider essential elements to the story, as these setting elements are what the story project was created/intended to convey.
